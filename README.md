# Megathronic Instagram Checker

## Very Important 

Hello, the most important rule you need to know when using this software is that logging into the target account with this software without using a proxy or tor address will ban your ip address. The recommended use is to configure the target's country in the torrc file and then start the tor proxy and use this software. If you use this software from the same ip address all the time, you will not benefit.

## Description

This project is a Python-based brute force tool designed to work with Instagram's API. The tool works by sending requests and is compatible with mobile devices. Users must have their own proxy service to use this tool effectively. Additionally, users can attempt to crack passwords using wordlists.

## Features

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/archescyber/instagram-forcer
```

2. Install the requires:

```
pip install instaloader
```

3. Install the proxy service.  Make sure you have a valid proxy server to route your requests through.

## Usage

1. Configure the tool:
- Edit the configuration file to include your proxy details.
- Enter the target username and the wordlist you want to use for password attempts.

2. Run the script:

```
python main.py
```

3. Monitor the output for progress and results as the tool attempts to crack the password.

## Important Notes

- **Proxy Requirement**: Users must have their own proxy service. The tool will not work without a valid proxy.

- **Wordlist Usage**: Users can specify a wordlist to attempt to crack the password. Make sure your wordlist is formatted correctly for best performance.

- **Ethical Considerations**: Use this tool responsibly and only on accounts you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized access to accounts is illegal and unethical.
- **API Rate Limits**: Use a good proxy service to avoid temporary access suspensions. You will need this to bypass API rate limits.
